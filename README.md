# Gcode Exporter

Export edges paths or polylines as gcode files for digital fabrication
Gcode Exporter is not a slicer, just a tool that allows to export a custom path as gocode file in order to use it for digital fabrication purposes (e.g. 3D Printing)

### Installation:

1. Start Blender. Open User Preferences, the addons tab
2. Click "install from file" and point Blender at the downloaded zip ("Install..." for Blender 2.80)
3. Activate Gcode-Exporter add-on from user preferences
4. Save user preferences if you want to have it on at startup. (This could be not necessary for Blender 2.80 if "Auto-Save Preferences" id on)

Gcode Exporter is free and open-source. I really think that this is the power of Blender and I wanted to give my small contribution to it.
If you like my work and you want to help to continue the development of Gcode Exporter, please consider to make a small donation. Any small contribution is really appreciated, thanks! :-D
